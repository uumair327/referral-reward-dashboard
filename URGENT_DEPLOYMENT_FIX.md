## 🔍 ISSUE IDENTIFIED
The site HTML loads but JavaScript/CSS files return 404 errors. This is a **base href** issue common with GitHub Pages.

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

The problem is that Angular is looking for assets at the root domain instead of the repository path.

### **Root Cause:**
- GitHub Pages serves at: `https://uumair327.github.io/referral-reward-dashboard/`
- Angular is looking for assets at: `https://uumair327.github.io/` (missing repo path)

### **Solution:**
Update the base href in index.html and build configuration.
